technology has been around for a long time

when did it become problematic?
when we went from low-tech to high-tech, bc in going high-tech we became further disembodied, further removed from our physical self and physical reality

[GUI]
specifically, this paper will focus on GUIs or graphical user interfaces
as one of the first "portals" to this virtual, alternative reality
i will discuss how it has transformed from a well-intentioned “graphical user interface” to a smooth design “anesthetic aesthetic” which we have no agency over as consumers

to go over some definitions
what i mean by virtual reality means outside of my physical body
not all GUIs are bad, in this paper i am specifically looking at GUI of consumer tech rather than commercial tech

in talking about tech and user agency
i feel that it's necessary to talk about the history of GUIs
and how it arrived to what it is today is shaped by our current consumerist capitalist society
i will discuss current critiques of the dark patterns of user interfaces
and i want to talk about the consumers as precariats

[Precariat]
amalgamation of the words precarious and proletariat
meaning a person living with instability and insecurity in society
how this society developed characters like Melville and Bartleby, who both find themselves living socially precarious lives

in the context of the readings we have done together in this class
i want to talk about boredom as a form of resistance to these GUIs

the concept of boredom as the opposite of being removed from our physical bodies, physical realm to some virtual reality
and instead to be fully present
[Kracauer]
i want to discuss the critiques of how the standardization of our attention and time is tied to slavery and colonialism with jenny odell's writings on the topic
i want to talk about artists who chose to stay in the present and who saw beauty in repair, in things people labelled trash
[Noah Purifoy]
i want to discuss authors interested in topics of repair and maintenance
namely donna j haraway and the importance she places on speculative fiction for reimagining the future
[Haraway]
